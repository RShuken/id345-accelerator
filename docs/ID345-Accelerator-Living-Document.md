## 1. Program Overview

### The Origin Story

**Colorado's First AI Accelerator. Born from a Community of Builders.**

ID345 started as a Wednesday night meetup in Denver -- a room full of people who wanted to build things with AI. Not just talk about it. Build. Every week, that room got fuller. Coders showed up alongside artists, startup founders sat next to people who had never written a line of code, and something remarkable happened: they started helping each other ship real products.

That community now spans 3+ chapters, with sessions alternating between AI coding and AI generative media and art. We have watched members go from "I have an idea" to "I have paying customers" in weeks. AI has made it possible for anyone with a clear problem and the drive to solve it to build something real. What has not changed is that builders do their best work when they are not alone.

### What the Accelerator Is

ID345 Accelerator exists to give that next step to the builders who are ready for it.

This is a 6-week program, mostly remote, with weekly in-person sessions at the ID345 space in Denver and a Demo Day finale where cohort companies present to investors, mentors, and the broader community. Each cohort is intentionally small -- 10 to 15 companies -- because we believe in depth over scale, especially in a first cohort.

### What Makes This Different

What makes this different from other accelerators? Three things.

**We come from community, not from capital.** Our cohort members are not strangers cold-applying to a program. They are builders we have watched grow, validated by real peers, pressure-tested in real sessions.

**We welcome non-traditional founders.** Some of our most impressive builders have never written traditional code. AI has changed who gets to be a founder, and our program reflects that.

**We build together.** This is not a program where you disappear into a Zoom room for six weeks. The ID345 community -- mentors, alumni, fellow builders -- stays with you before, during, and after the cohort.

### Program Leadership

The program is led by a director with 15 years of global accelerator experience and an early-stage VC background. This is not our first accelerator. But it is Colorado's first AI accelerator, and we are building it the way we build everything here: together, with the community, one honest step at a time.

**[TO DISCUSS]** Eugene -- any thoughts on how your role and involvement should be described in this section? Do you want to be positioned as a co-lead, advisor, or sponsor in the public-facing version of this document?

## 2. Investment Thesis

### The Shift in Who Builds

**The next wave of fundable startups will not come from Stanford CS programs. They will come from communities like ID345.**

Here is what has changed. AI development tools -- large language models, no-code platforms, generative frameworks -- have collapsed the cost and complexity of building a first product. A solo founder with domain expertise and a clear customer pain point can now ship a working prototype in days, not months. The barrier to entry is no longer technical skill. It is clarity of problem, speed of execution, and willingness to iterate.

### The New Class of Founder (lets look at what really makes a great team and how we think about different roles matter - GTM is more important and understadning product) - This doesn't have to always be an AI product, what does the dna of the of the cohort look like and split between wrappers and other types of AI tech. 

This shift has created a new class of founder: people who deeply understand a market because they have lived in it, and who can now build for that market directly. Teachers building ed-tech. Healthcare workers building patient tools. Creatives building production workflows. These founders do not look like the typical accelerator applicant, but their startups are closer to product-market fit on day one because their insight is earned, not researched.

### Community as a Filter

ID345 is where these founders already gather. Our community acts as a natural filter: members who show up week after week, who ship projects, who help others debug -- they have already demonstrated the consistency and drive that early-stage investors look for. Community validation is a leading indicator of founder quality.

### The Investor Opportunity

The opportunity for early investors is straightforward: get access to a curated pipeline of AI-native startups led by founders who build fast, solve real problems, and have been pressure-tested by a community of peers before they ever pitch a fund.

### The Colorado Advantage

Colorado is underserved in AI startup infrastructure compared to coastal hubs, but it has the talent, the cost advantages, and now the community to support a serious pipeline. ID345 Accelerator is how that pipeline gets built.

**[TO DISCUSS]** Eugene -- does this thesis align with how you would frame the opportunity for investors in your network? Any angles you would add or sharpen?

**[NOTES]** _Space for Eugene's input on investment thesis framing, target investor profiles, and messaging._

## 3. The Mentor Network

### How Mentorship Works at ID345

Every startup in the cohort is assigned a dedicated mentor from the ID345 community. These are experienced builders, founders, and professionals who have been active in our community and understand the AI-era founder journey.

### Mentor Commitment and Cadence

Each mentor is required to provide **two touchpoints per week** with their assigned startup. Mentors set their own schedule for these check-ins -- they can be virtual or in-person, formal or informal -- but they must happen consistently. This is not optional coaching. It is structured accountability.

### Director and Staff 1-on-1s

On top of mentor check-ins, each startup also has a separate weekly **30-minute 1-on-1 with the program directors and staff**. This means every startup has at minimum three dedicated support conversations per week: two with their mentor, one with leadership.

### Mentor-Director Sync

Every **Friday**, mentors meet with the program directors to discuss startup progress, flag concerns, and coordinate support. This ensures no startup falls through the cracks and that mentors have the backing they need to be effective.

### Specialist Mentors

In addition to assigned mentors, each week we bring in **specialist mentors** who are experts in that week's theme. These specialists are present on **Tuesday or Thursday** (alternating weeks) to run focused working sessions, office hours, and deep dives on the weekly topic.

#### Specialist Focus by Week

- **Week 1 specialists**: Problem definition, customer discovery frameworks
- **Week 2 specialists**: Product development, technical architecture, AI implementation
- **Week 3 specialists**: Market research, customer interviews, validation methods
- **Week 4 specialists**: Business modeling, pricing strategy, unit economics
- **Week 5 specialists**: Pitch coaching, financial modeling, investor relations
- **Week 6 specialists**: Demo preparation, presentation skills, networking strategy

**[TO DISCUSS]** Eugene -- would you like to be slotted in as a specialist mentor for any particular week? Week 5 (pitch/investor prep) and Week 4 (business model) seem like natural fits given your background, but open to your preference.

**[NOTES]** _Additional mentor recruitment -- who else should we approach? Eugene's network contacts to consider._

## 4. Six-Week Program Outline

### The Weekly Rhythm

Every week follows the same core structure so founders can build a rhythm. The content and focus changes each week, but the cadence stays consistent:

| Day | Activity | Format |
|-----|----------|--------|
| **Monday** | 30-min 1-on-1s with directors/staff | In-person or virtual |
| **Monday** | Founder weekly lunch (encouraged, self-organized) | In-person |
| **Tuesday or Thursday** | Specialist mentor sessions (alternating weeks) | In-person at the space |
| **Wednesday** | Community event -- startups pitch and demo | In-person at ID345 |
| **Friday afternoon** | Founder Stories session | In-person or virtual |
| **Friday** | Mentor-director sync meeting | Virtual |
| **Ongoing** | Assigned mentor check-ins (2x per week minimum) | Mentor's schedule |

**[TO DISCUSS]** Eugene -- does this weekly cadence work for your schedule? Which sessions would you want to attend regularly vs. drop in on?
