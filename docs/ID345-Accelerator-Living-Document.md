## 1. Program Overview

### The Origin Story

**Colorado's First AI Accelerator. Born from a Community of Builders.**

ID345 started as a Wednesday night meetup in Denver -- a room full of people who wanted to build things with AI. Not just talk about it. Build. Every week, that room got fuller. Coders showed up alongside artists, startup founders sat next to people who had never written a line of code, and something remarkable happened: they started helping each other ship real products.

That community now spans 3+ chapters, with sessions alternating between AI coding and AI generative media and art. We have watched members go from "I have an idea" to "I have paying customers" in weeks. AI has made it possible for anyone with a clear problem and the drive to solve it to build something real. What has not changed is that builders do their best work when they are not alone.

### What the Accelerator Is

ID345 Accelerator exists to give that next step to the builders who are ready for it.

This is a 6-week program, mostly remote, with weekly in-person sessions at the ID345 space in Denver and a Demo Day finale where cohort companies present to investors, mentors, and the broader community. Each cohort is intentionally small -- 10 to 15 companies -- because we believe in depth over scale, especially in a first cohort.

### What Makes This Different

What makes this different from other accelerators? Three things.

**We come from community, not from capital.** Our cohort members are not strangers cold-applying to a program. They are builders we have watched grow, validated by real peers, pressure-tested in real sessions.

**We welcome non-traditional founders.** Some of our most impressive builders have never written traditional code. AI has changed who gets to be a founder, and our program reflects that.

**We build together.** This is not a program where you disappear into a Zoom room for six weeks. The ID345 community -- mentors, alumni, fellow builders -- stays with you before, during, and after the cohort.

### Program Leadership

The program is led by a director with 15 years of global accelerator experience and an early-stage VC background, with strategic sponsorship and advisory support from an active early-stage VC. This is not our first accelerator. But it is Colorado's first AI accelerator, and we are building it the way we build everything here: together, with the community, one honest step at a time.

## 2. Investment Thesis

### The Shift in Who Builds

**The next wave of fundable startups will not come from Stanford CS programs. They will come from communities like ID345.**

Here is what has changed. AI development tools -- large language models, no-code platforms, generative frameworks -- have collapsed the cost and complexity of building a first product. A solo founder with domain expertise and a clear customer pain point can now ship a working prototype in days, not months. The barrier to entry is no longer technical skill. It is clarity of problem, speed of execution, and willingness to iterate.

### The New Class of Founder

This shift has created a new class of founder: people who deeply understand a market because they have lived in it, and who can now build for that market directly. Teachers building ed-tech. Healthcare workers building patient tools. Creatives building production workflows. These founders do not look like the typical accelerator applicant, but their startups are closer to product-market fit on day one because their insight is earned, not researched.

### What Makes a Great Founding Team in the AI Era

AI has changed what a founding team needs to look like. A dedicated development team is no longer the prerequisite it once was -- a domain expert with modern AI tools can build a working product. But domain expertise alone is not enough to build a company.

The most critical gap we see in early-stage AI startups is not technical. It is go-to-market. A nurse who deeply understands hospital workflows has earned insight that no outside researcher can replicate -- but without the ability to sell, distribute, and acquire customers, that insight stays trapped in a prototype. Go-to-market strategy and sales capability are now among the most important factors in whether an AI startup succeeds or fails.

The strongest founding teams we look for combine three things:

- **Domain expertise** -- deep, lived understanding of the problem and the customer
- **Product sense** -- the ability to translate that understanding into a solution people will actually use
- **Go-to-market capability** -- a clear plan for how the product reaches customers, and someone on the team who can execute on sales, distribution, and partnerships

In the AI era, what used to require a three-person team -- domain expert, developer, business lead -- can now be covered by one or two people on the product and technical side. But the GTM function cannot be automated. The founders who succeed will be the ones who understand that building the product is only half the job. Getting it into the hands of paying customers is the other half, and that requires a different set of skills.

### Community as a Filter

ID345 is where these founders already gather. Our community acts as a natural filter: members who show up week after week, who ship projects, who help others debug -- they have already demonstrated the consistency and drive that early-stage investors look for. Community validation is a leading indicator of founder quality.

### The Investor Opportunity

The opportunity for early investors is straightforward: get access to a curated pipeline of AI-native startups led by founders who build fast, solve real problems, and have been pressure-tested by a community of peers before they ever pitch a fund.

### The Colorado Advantage

Colorado is underserved in AI startup infrastructure compared to coastal hubs, but it has the talent, the cost advantages, and now the community to support a serious pipeline. ID345 Accelerator is how that pipeline gets built.

## 3. Cohort Composition Strategy

### Building a Deliberate Portfolio

The first cohort of 10 to 15 companies should not be assembled randomly. How we compose the cohort reflects our thesis about what works, what we want to learn, and how we manage risk across a small portfolio.

Not every company in the cohort needs to be building an AI product. Some of the strongest opportunities come from founders who use AI as a competitive advantage in a traditional market -- not as the product itself, but as the engine that lets them move faster, serve customers better, or operate at a scale their competitors cannot match.

### Three Categories of AI Startups

We think about cohort companies across three categories:

**AI Wrapper Companies** -- Startups built on top of existing AI models and APIs. These companies add value through user experience, workflow integration, vertical specialization, or data curation rather than through novel AI research. They ship fast and iterate quickly. The risk is defensibility -- if the underlying model improves or the platform builds the feature natively, the wrapper can lose its edge. The opportunity is speed to market and direct customer value.

**Deep AI Technology Companies** -- Startups building novel AI capabilities, proprietary models, or foundational infrastructure. These companies have stronger technical moats but longer development timelines, higher capital needs, and more uncertainty about product-market fit. They require founders with both deep technical skill and the ability to translate that technology into a product someone will pay for.

**AI-Advantaged Companies** -- Startups that are not AI-focused in their value proposition but use AI to compete unfairly in their market. A logistics company that uses AI to optimize routing. A healthcare platform that uses AI to reduce administrative burden. A creative agency that uses AI to produce at 10x the speed of competitors. These founders are often domain experts first, and their AI advantage is a means to an end, not the end itself.

### Portfolio Mix and Risk

For the first cohort, we want a deliberate mix across these categories. A cohort that is entirely wrapper companies carries concentration risk. A cohort that is entirely deep tech may not produce Demo Day-ready results in six weeks. A balanced portfolio gives us the best chance of strong outcomes while also giving us data on which category of AI startup benefits most from our program structure.

The target composition for Cohort 1:

| Category | Target Range | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| AI Wrapper Companies | 3-5 companies | Fast iteration, strong Demo Day potential, validates our speed-focused program design |
| Deep AI Technology | 2-4 companies | Higher ceiling outcomes, tests our ability to support technically complex startups |
| AI-Advantaged Companies | 3-5 companies | Closest to product-market fit, strongest domain expertise, validates our thesis on non-traditional founders |

This is not a rigid formula. The right composition depends on the quality of applicants in each category. But going in with a framework ensures we are making intentional choices about the portfolio, not just filling seats.

### What This Means for Selection

Cohort composition directly informs selection. When reviewing applications, we are not just evaluating individual companies -- we are building a portfolio. A strong deep-tech application might be selected over an equally strong wrapper application if the cohort is already heavy on wrappers. The goal is a cohort where companies learn from each other and where our thesis about what works gets tested across multiple categories.

## 4. The Mentor Network

### How Mentorship Works at ID345

Every startup in the cohort is assigned a dedicated mentor from the ID345 community. These are experienced builders, founders, and professionals who have been active in our community and understand the AI-era founder journey.

### Mentor Commitment and Cadence

Each mentor is required to provide **two touchpoints per week** with their assigned startup. Mentors set their own schedule for these check-ins -- they can be virtual or in-person, formal or informal -- but they must happen consistently. This is not optional coaching. It is structured accountability.

### Director and Staff 1-on-1s

On top of mentor check-ins, each startup also has a separate weekly **30-minute 1-on-1 with the program directors and staff**. This means every startup has at minimum three dedicated support conversations per week: two with their mentor, one with leadership.

### Mentor-Director Sync

Every **Friday**, mentors meet with the program directors to discuss startup progress, flag concerns, and coordinate support. This ensures no startup falls through the cracks and that mentors have the backing they need to be effective.

### Specialist Mentors

In addition to assigned mentors, each week we bring in **specialist mentors** who are experts in that week's theme. These specialists are present on **Tuesday or Thursday** (alternating weeks) to run focused working sessions, office hours, and deep dives on the weekly topic.

#### Specialist Focus by Week

- **Week 1 specialists**: Problem definition, customer discovery frameworks
- **Week 2 specialists**: Product development, technical architecture, AI implementation
- **Week 3 specialists**: Market research, customer interviews, validation methods
- **Week 4 specialists**: Business modeling, pricing strategy, unit economics
- **Week 5 specialists**: Pitch coaching, financial modeling, investor relations
- **Week 6 specialists**: Demo preparation, presentation skills, networking strategy

Eugene is confirmed as a specialist mentor for Week 4 (business model and go-to-market) and Week 5 (pitch preparation and investor readiness), with availability for additional sessions as needed.
