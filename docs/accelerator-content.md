## 1. Program Overview

**Colorado's First AI Accelerator. Born from a Community of Builders.**

ID345 started as a Wednesday night meetup in Denver -- a room full of people who wanted to build things with AI. Not just talk about it. Build. Every week, that room got fuller. Coders showed up alongside artists, startup founders sat next to people who had never written a line of code, and something remarkable happened: they started helping each other ship real products.

That community now spans 3+ chapters, with sessions alternating between AI coding and AI generative media and art. We have watched members go from "I have an idea" to "I have paying customers" in weeks. AI has made it possible for anyone with a clear problem and the drive to solve it to build something real. What has not changed is that builders do their best work when they are not alone.

ID345 Accelerator exists to give that next step to the builders who are ready for it.

This is a 6-week program, mostly remote, with weekly in-person sessions at the ID345 space in Denver and a Demo Day finale where cohort companies present to investors, mentors, and the broader community. Each cohort is intentionally small -- 10 to 15 companies -- because we believe in depth over scale, especially in a first cohort.

What makes this different from other accelerators? Three things.

**We come from community, not from capital.** Our cohort members are not strangers cold-applying to a program. They are builders we have watched grow, validated by real peers, pressure-tested in real sessions.

**We welcome non-traditional founders.** Some of our most impressive builders have never written traditional code. AI has changed who gets to be a founder, and our program reflects that.

**We build together.** This is not a program where you disappear into a Zoom room for six weeks. The ID345 community -- mentors, alumni, fellow builders -- stays with you before, during, and after the cohort.

The program is led by a director with 15 years of global accelerator experience and an early-stage VC background. This is not our first accelerator. But it is Colorado's first AI accelerator, and we are building it the way we build everything here: together, with the community, one honest step at a time.

## 2. Investment Thesis

**The next wave of fundable startups will not come from Stanford CS programs. They will come from communities like ID345.**

Here is what has changed. AI development tools -- large language models, no-code platforms, generative frameworks -- have collapsed the cost and complexity of building a first product. A solo founder with domain expertise and a clear customer pain point can now ship a working prototype in days, not months. The barrier to entry is no longer technical skill. It is clarity of problem, speed of execution, and willingness to iterate.

This shift has created a new class of founder: people who deeply understand a market because they have lived in it, and who can now build for that market directly. Teachers building ed-tech. Healthcare workers building patient tools. Creatives building production workflows. These founders do not look like the typical accelerator applicant, but their startups are closer to product-market fit on day one because their insight is earned, not researched.

ID345 is where these founders already gather. Our community acts as a natural filter: members who show up week after week, who ship projects, who help others debug -- they have already demonstrated the consistency and drive that early-stage investors look for. Community validation is a leading indicator of founder quality.

The opportunity for early investors is straightforward: get access to a curated pipeline of AI-native startups led by founders who build fast, solve real problems, and have been pressure-tested by a community of peers before they ever pitch a fund.

Colorado is underserved in AI startup infrastructure compared to coastal hubs, but it has the talent, the cost advantages, and now the community to support a serious pipeline. ID345 Accelerator is how that pipeline gets built.

## 3. The Mentor Network

### How Mentorship Works at ID345

Every startup in the cohort is assigned a dedicated mentor from the ID345 community. These are experienced builders, founders, and professionals who have been active in our community and understand the AI-era founder journey.

### Mentor Commitment

Each mentor is required to provide **two touchpoints per week** with their assigned startup. Mentors set their own schedule for these check-ins -- they can be virtual or in-person, formal or informal -- but they must happen consistently. This is not optional coaching. It is structured accountability.

On top of mentor check-ins, each startup also has a separate weekly **30-minute 1-on-1 with the program directors and staff**. This means every startup has at minimum three dedicated support conversations per week: two with their mentor, one with leadership.

### Mentor-Director Sync

Every **Friday**, mentors meet with the program directors to discuss startup progress, flag concerns, and coordinate support. This ensures no startup falls through the cracks and that mentors have the backing they need to be effective.

### Specialist Mentors

In addition to assigned mentors, each week we bring in **specialist mentors** who are experts in that week's theme. These specialists are present on **Tuesday or Thursday** (alternating weeks) to run focused working sessions, office hours, and deep dives on the weekly topic.

- **Week 1 specialists**: Problem definition, customer discovery frameworks
- **Week 2 specialists**: Product development, technical architecture, AI implementation
- **Week 3 specialists**: Market research, customer interviews, validation methods
- **Week 4 specialists**: Business modeling, pricing strategy, unit economics
- **Week 5 specialists**: Pitch coaching, financial modeling, investor relations
- **Week 6 specialists**: Demo preparation, presentation skills, networking strategy

### Week 1: Foundation and Vision

**Theme**: Who are you building for and why?

Founders lock in their problem statement, define their target customer, and present their current product state to the cohort. This week establishes a shared baseline and identifies the biggest gaps to close in the next five weeks.

**Monday**: 1-on-1 kickoff meetings. Directors assess each startup's current state, set initial goals, and align on what success looks like by Demo Day.

**Tuesday**: Specialist session on problem definition and customer discovery frameworks. How to articulate your problem in a way that investors, customers, and mentors immediately understand.

**Wednesday**: Community event. Each startup gives a 2-minute introduction -- who they are, what they are building, and what problem they are solving. First public practice.

**Friday**: Founder Stories -- a guest founder shares their journey from idea to launch. What they wish they knew at the start. Q&A with the cohort.
